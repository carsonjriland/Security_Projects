# Security_Projects
These are some small security related projects that I have put together for fun.

# KeyLogger.py
This is keylogger I programmed using python. When running, every 60 seconds it will send via email a log of all keys pressed to an email called "carsonKeyLogger@gmail.com". 
I chose to put it together for educational purposes only to work on my python understanding. 
My next step for this project is to use the pyinstaller package to turn the .py code into a .exe for further experience.
